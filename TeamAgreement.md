# Team Agreement
## Communication plan:
We will communicate with each other through Zoom, Discord, and, Slack.
Our communication includes sketches, visuals, or, any means necessary to communicate ideas correctly.
We take turns in exchanging ideas.
Every idea is written down and each member is given enough time to explain his ideas then other members can make comments or add to it. (Group brainstorming)
We take a vote before any decision is made.
After each step, we give time for feedback, concerns, and objections.
No idea is a bad idea, everything that a member suggests is impressive, we just have to choose the best for the team within the time provided.
There is no judgment nor blaming. Every member is essential to the team and a crucial part of its success.
## Conflict plan:
Discussion and listening are our way to go.
First, we will try to understand the cause and the source of the conflict.
Try to list the possible solution depending on the type of conflict.
Keeping in mind that our main goal is to gain experience in teamwork and make a successful project, so nothing should be taken personal.
Work plan:
Tasks will be identifying and assigned based on the teams best interest
We will be using Trello for managing the work and tasks in general.
A report on everyones work will be reported daily to the team for feedback.
## Git process:
Everyone in the team will have access to the project's repo.
Each member works on a branch and will have time to explain his work.
Merges will happen from once to twice a day, as we see fit.
Merges will only occur if assigned members agreed on.
We will be communicating on Slack to decide the time of each merge to avoid any merging conflicts.
As a team, we are all aware of every area in this agreement and we believe that communication is our strength.
